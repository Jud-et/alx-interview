Minimum Operations
This project involves calculating the minimum number of operations required to achieve exactly n characters in a file using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations.

Problem Description
In a text file initially containing a single character H, you can perform the following operations:

Copy All: Copies all characters currently in the file to the clipboard.
Paste: Pastes the clipboard content to the file.
Given a number n, the task is to determine the fewest number of operations needed to have exactly n characters in the file.

Example
For n = 9:

Start with H.
Copy All.
Paste (results in HH).
Paste (results in HHH).
Copy All.
Paste (results in HHHHHH).
Paste (results in HHHHHHHHH).
Number of operations: 6.

Approach
Prime Factorization:

The problem is solved by reducing it to the prime factorization of n.
Each prime factor corresponds to a sequence of operations to reach n.
Algorithm Outline:

If n is less than 2, return 0 as it's impossible to achieve n characters.
For each prime factor of n, add the factor to the operation count.
Continue this until n is reduced to 1.
Dynamic Programming Insight:

Use dynamic programming principles to solve subproblems and build the final solution.

Main file for testing the minOperations function
"""

minOperations = __import__('0-minoperations').minOperations

n = 4
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))

n = 12
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))
Usage
Run the Main File:

Execute 0-main.py to test the minOperations function.
Ensure that 0-minoperations.py is executable and correctly implemented.
Testing:

The provided 0-main.py script tests the function with different values of n.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Files should be executable (chmod +x <file>).
Code should be PEP 8 compliant.
